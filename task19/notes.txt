There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.


Turn 1 creates the desired responsibe layout, for desktop applications the header is on top,
the welcome message is at the left, the bumping heart is at the right, and the footer is at the bottom.
When the device is mobile, the middle sections are wrapped one below the other.

Turn 2 makes the requested changes, now the bumping heart is positioned above the welcome message.
Both the text and the heart are bigger.



Doesn't follow non-formatting constraints: Turn 1 has this error becuase the model does not position
the bumping heart below the header, and below the welcome message as the prompt required. The heart is
positioned below the welcome message.

Doesn't understand user intent: Turn 1 has this error because of the same reasons explained above.

Incomplete code: Turn 1 has this error because the flex direction propertie is set to column while it
should be set to column reverse, since the bumping heart is after the welcome message

Verbosity: the model response is too long, it can be more concise since the requested application
is simple, it doesn't involve much elements or complexity.

Adds information that was not asked for: The model adds information about effects that can be achieved
using javascript, deviating from the main user's intention.
