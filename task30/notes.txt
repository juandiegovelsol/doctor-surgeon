There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.

In turn 1, the model showcases an outstanding ability to develop the required task, it demonstrates
instruction's deep understanding, reasoning abilities, and adheres to constraints. The delivered game
has a 15x15 letters grid where 10 words are vertically and horizontally positioned, all the other cells
are filled with random letters, and the words can be found by coloring the corresponding cells.

In turn 1, the model explanation is accurate and demonstrates how the application works.

In turn 2, the model follows all the instructions and modifies the code to invert some of the words.
Now, some words are reversed and others are positioned normally. The words in the words table are
displayed normally as requested.



Turn 1 has a verbosity issue because it is very long, making more dificult for the user to understand
the keypoints of the explanantion. A more concise explanation would be better.
