Instruction Following Errors:
- Turn 1: The model provided both Grid and Flexbox implementations without clarifying which to use.
   While both approaches were valid, the lack of clear guidance or prioritization left the user to decide, which could cause confusion.

   'Coding - Semantic - Incomplete Code'

- Turn 2: Instead of consolidating functionality into a single toggle button for the navigation menu and sidebar,
   the model implemented two separate buttons. This approach was unnecessary and inefficient, deviating from the prompt's intent.

- Turn 3: The categories dropdown was incorrectly retained in the navigation on larger screens,
   violating the userâ€™s explicit instruction to only include the dropdown on smaller screens.

   'Instruction Following Errors - Constraint Following - Doesn'T Follow Non-Formatting Constraints'

- Turn 6: Although the dropdown was removed from larger screens, the model failed to ensure that the sidebar became
   the sole visible component for categories on desktop. Redundant styles and logic for the dropdown remained, complicating the code unnecessarily.

Feasibility Errors:
- Turn 3: The categories dropdown menu appeared misaligned, positioned under the footer instead of directly beneath
   the Categories button. This was caused by the absence of position: relative on the parent container, which is necessary
   for proper alignment of absolutely positioned elements like the dropdown.

   'Coding - Semantic - Incomplete Code'


- Turn 7: The reliance on position: absolute for the dropdown menu introduced potential alignment issues in dynamic scenarios,
   such as resizing or varying content sizes. The model did not test or verify the robustness of this approach.

Incomplete Code:
- Turn 2: The model did not include functionality to close the sidebar or dropdown when clicking outside of these elements.
   This is standard behavior for dropdowns and sidebars in modern UI design and its absence made the solution less user-friendly.
- Turn 7: No logic was added to dynamically reset dropdown and sidebar states during resizing. This could result in overlapping
   or redundant elements when transitioning between smaller and larger screens.
- Turn 7: The desktop sidebar (#desktop-sidebar) lacked ARIA attributes or focus management to ensure accessibility compliance.
   For example, role="complementary" and aria-labelledby attributes were not used to associate the sidebar with its heading, leaving accessibility incomplete.

Ambiguity:
- Turn 5: The model vaguely addressed the dropdown misalignment issue, suggesting CSS adjustments without clearly identifying
   the root cause (missing position: relative on the parent container).
- Turn 6: The model retained redundant dropdown styles and logic (e.g., display: none !important;) on larger screens without
   justifying their necessity. This introduced unnecessary complexity and could confuse developers maintaining the codebase.
