T1, the model achieves the time frame interactive feature to visualize different candles according to the requested instructions.

T1, The model has an incomplete code error since all the price values are not being displayed,
for instance, the last hour values are not correctly displayed when the time frame is changed
to hourly candles

T2, the model delivers incorrect code since the drawChart function wipes out the chart inner HTML
which erases the poreviously created horizontal and vertical crosshairs. This gives the illusion that the model
did not understood the prompt but crosshairs with price and time labels were added, just the implementation is not correct.

T2, the code calls the aggregateData method each time the mousemove event is triggered which is a suboptimal and innecessary implementation.
This may cause efficiency issues when handling considerable size data.
