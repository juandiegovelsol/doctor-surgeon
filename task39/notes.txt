There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.


In turn 1, the model implements an interactive story that can be selected through an user
interface, allowing the user to modify and see the dinamic story.

In turn 1, the model implements coherent stories after selecting each posibility.

In turn 2, the model understands the prompt requirements, removing the "lookForKeyAgain" key
that is not linked with any previous branch.

In turn 2, the model tries to add more branches to reach at least 5 branches depth without asking
for that.

In turn 3, with the generated branches it is sufficient to have at least 5 level depth, following
teh required constraint.



In turn 1 the model includes a "Corrected ID" comment in the code which is a minor inaccuracy.
The object ID is not corrected because it is the first time that appears.

In turn 1, the model has an assignment error, the "lookForKeyAgain" key is not chained to any
of the possible branches so it does not makes sense to be included.

In turns 1 and 2, the model has an "Doesn't follow non-formatting constraints" issue because not all
the branches have 5 branches depth as required in the prompt

In turn 3, the model generates incorrect code, because given the depth level in the story
the model is not able to generate the entire code. This could be avoided just by providing the
new story branches instead of the complete code.

In turn 3, the model Can't answer, but doesn't punt because the code response seems too long for
the model's capabilities.

In turn 3, the model adds information that was not asked for. More than 5 level depht is included
for some branches, making the entire code too long.
