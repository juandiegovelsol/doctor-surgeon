There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.


Turn 1 has an outdated fact error since the suggested way to create the React
application is deprecated, and if the user has React 19 or newer versions,
it may be several installation issues.

Turn 1 has an incorrect code error since the npm command to create the React
application makes the code to be impossible to execute

Turn 1 and 2 has a "Doesn't follow formatting constraints" since the border
is colored darker than the cards background, the prompt asks that it must be lighter



Turn 1 and turn 2 implements a mostly correct prototype since it includes a
centered rounded image, a name in bold and capital letters, an assosiated email
in thinner and grey letters, and a status in red or green.
