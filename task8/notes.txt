There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.





Turn 1 successfully implements the navbar with react-router-dom, allowing the single page
application to have multiple sections as required. The cart information is stored in a CartContext
allowing all the pages to access and modify the information in a simple way.

Turn 2 sucessfully achieves all the requested modifications, the key problem was solved by adding the
cartItems index to the hey value, the item remove problem was solved by finding the last index that
matches the corresponging item id. Now the removeItem method only removes one of the selected items



Turn 1 has an incorrect code error when adding clothes, the li element keys inside
the Cart component are repeated when a same article is added to the cart multiple times. This creates
an execution error since a list item generated through a map method must have unique key elements

Turn 1 has an incorrect code error when removing clother, the removeItem method defined in the
context removes all the items with the clicked id, so if an item is added multiple times and one of
them is removed, all the others are removed as well. This is not desired.

Turn 1 adds information that was not asked for, the summary page shows the required information but
the it is not expected to have a cart page and that the summary page is accessible from it. This was
not requested and is not functional.

Turn 1 has readability issues since the clothes components can be integrated in only one component
reused to render shoes, pants, shirts, and hats. It is not necessary to have a separate component for
each type of clothing
