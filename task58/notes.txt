- I want to implement an accessible webpage with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where users can see and listen to the different sections and elements on the page. It must consist of a header section where the title is included, a content section where at least 5 services are displayed, and a footer section with a phone contact number (completely random). When each section is entered a voice should announce which section is being entered. When any text is hovered, the voice must read it.

Provide the complete code with only one explanation paragraph.

- I want to improve the sections' readability (related to the voice) because some sections are not being read correctly. I can't focus on the services section using the Tab key so any voice is hearable. Also, it seems the services are being placed too close to each other so the reading feature does not work correctly. Please add styles to increase the space between sections and to make the layout more visually appealing. Also, fix the focusing issue.

- Great, now I would like to add a deactivate sound button so that users with high-sight capabilities can disable it from the entire page.

Turn 1, The model seems to understand most of the prompt requirements and implements screen readers
Turn 2, the model understands all the requirements and makes modifications so now the application is 
more visually appealing and all sections can be correctly read.
Turn 3, the model implements a fully functional button that enables and disables the screen reader
on all the webpage texts


Errors Turn 1: Minor visual code output error

-All the page sections can't be focused using the tab key, the services section is not visually
focusable using this key, but still the webpage reads the content.
