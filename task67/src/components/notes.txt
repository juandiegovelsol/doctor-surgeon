In turn 1 The model does not understands the user intent, it was explicitly asked that only the code had to be
delivered but the model provided instructions to set up the Vite application

Turn 1 has a wrong logical direction issue in terms of the responsive design because the produced code
seems to be designed only for mobile devices, as it has only a single thin column, its disposition is
fully vertical, which is not aligned to the prompt requirements.

Turn 1 has constant value assignment error because in a real implementation each client must have its
image file, in the application the same image is passed to all the cards.

Turn 2 doesn't follow formatting constraints because the Content.module.scss and App.jsx files are not
changed and returned

Turn 2 has redundant information generation because some files are being repeated whit no changes.

Turn 2 has major code output error because the code has many issues, the cards are not visible in the
mobile version, the desktop version has scroll bar for the horizontal axis, the cards are not evenly
spaced, the cards are trimmed in the mobile version.
