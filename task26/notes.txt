There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.


Turn 1 tries to make modifications, which can be interpreted as an intent to fix the described issue.

Turn 2 successfully includes the undefined variable as a parameter in the updateSinglePlanet method.

Turn 2 modified the updateSinglePlanet calls to include each planet's radius.

Turn 3 modifies the code to increase or decrease the planet velocity by 1 unit as requested in the prompt.

Turn 3 changes the writable fields to plain text, to avoid textual inputs.



Turn 1 has an incorrect code issue becuase the changes made do not fix the described issues, the planets
still do not move as in the initial code.

Turn 1 has a Wrong logical direction error because the model tries to simplify the code, removing the window
boundaries and extracting some logic into a new function, but in the end those modifications have nothing to do
with the described issue.

Turn 3 has a "Doesn't understand user intent" because the prompt asks to dinamically update the speed values
which is not achieved, the velocity values are updated only with a change in the planet selector or with a click
in an speed change button.

Turn 3 has a formatting error because the speed overflows below the increase speed button.
