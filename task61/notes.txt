- I want to create a logo for my energy company with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It must consist of a light bulb silhouette that changes its inner color when the cursor hovers over it from dark to light, simulating the bulb powers on.

The light bulb shape must consist of a rounded shape on top, connected to a thinner cylinder on the bottom, only the exterior silhouette must be visible when the light is off, and all the inner content must be colored when the light is on.

Return the complete code and a concise explanation.

- I want to modify the bulb shape.
First, the content must be transparent when the light is off and colored when the light is on.

- The entire background color is still dark, some other modifications may be considered to ensure only the border is visible.

- The silhouette is correctly visible as desired, but now the entire shape background must be colored yellow when the cursor hovers over it

- Perfect. Now I want to change the way the top and down individual shapes are visually connected. I want the bottom line of the bulb-top container to be trimmed between the same part as the top line border of the bulb-base container is positioned. The final effect should be that only external lines of the whole figure must be visible.




In turn 1, the model understands the user intention and implements a basic rounded shape on top
and a thinner cylinder on the bottom.

In turn 1, the model understands the instructions that when hovered, the shape must give the illusion
that the bulb powers on and when the cursor leaves it must give the illusion of being off.

In turn 3, the model implements a solution to make transparent the shapes' background.

In turn 4, the model achieves the desired background coloring when the cursor hovers over the shape.





In turn 1, the model Doesn't follow formatting constraints because when the light is off, only the
silhouette must be visible and the entire background is colored in the same border color.

In turn 1, the model has an incomplete code issue because not all the inner content of the shape is
colored when the ligth is on, the borders are still visible. The shape must be colored as a whole,
not as two separate containers

In turn 1, the model does not understands the user intent because treats the light bulb as two
different containers, while they should be treated as a whole (even if the shape is built with
separate containers).

In turn 1, the model has a verbosity issue because the prompt asks to provide a concise explanation,
while the model explains almost every CSS rule.

In turn 2, the model has an incomplete code issue becuase it onlu modifies the background-color
property of the bulb-inner class while bulb-base and bulb-top still have the dark background color,
causing no change to be visible.

In turn 3, the model has a major output error because now the background color is transparent but when
the cursor hovers over the figure, only a part of the figure is colored in yellow.

In turn 5, the model does not understand the user intent, the model removes the entire bottom line of
the bulb-top container, causing the shape to be disconected
