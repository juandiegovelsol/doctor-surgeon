In turn 1, the model understands all the prompt requirements, it implements a classic Sudoku game that follows
the described rules. The numbers must be filled without being repeated in rows, columns, and 3x3 
smaller grids. 

In turn 1, the game is won when all the numbers are positioned following the described rules.

In turn 1, the game implements the difficulty level selectors that removes aproximately the 25%,
50%, and 75% for each corresponding level.

In turn 1, the explanation about how the game works is accurate and factually correct.

In turn 3, the model fully understands how to avoid filling ordered numbers from 1 to 9 for the first
3x3 grid and the first row. With the shuffled array now the implementation is completly sorted.




In turn 1, the model has a minor incomplete code issue that impacts the UI visualization. The empty
cells have different border properties that makes them to look different. Only the background should
be different.

In turn 2, the model Doesn't understand user intent and can't figure out how to fix the described
issues, and produces the same visual result as before.

In turn 2, the model has an Incorrect Assumption issue because it assumes that the prefilled class
inherits CSS rules from the cell class, just becuase they are applied together.

In turn 2, the model has an False Equivalency issue because it forces relationships between the cell
and the prefilled CSS class to explain why the styles are not applied as required while there is no
relation between the two classes. They can be applied independently.
