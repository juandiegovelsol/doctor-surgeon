There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.


Turn 1 implements the mental agility game as required.
The model includes any of the two different question posibilities.
The model understands the game must display a colored word with only two color and textual options.
The model displays the 2 different options to pick, each colored in red or blue.

Turn 2 designs and implements the scoring system so now the game counts the correct answers,
increments the score in the user interface, and ends the game if an incorrect answer is pressed.

Turn 3 implements the timer exactly as requested in the prompt. It consists of a timer in the
SS format that counts down until a correct answer is pressed. Every two correct questions the
timer's initial time is reduced by 1 second untilt the minimum of 3 seconds is reached.
