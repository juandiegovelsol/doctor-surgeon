Turn 1 translates the code from plain HTML and JS to a React application, it also
implements components for the Checklist and for the progress bar as requested.

Turn 2 fully understands the user intent and generates separate components,
now the structure is modular and scalable. Both components are included in the same
hierarchy level as the prompt requires.

Turn 2 also fixes the previous aspect issue without asking to fix it.




In turn 1 the model has a Doesn't follow formatting constraints issue because
the visual aspect of the app does not remain as in the previous application.
Now, the checklist is positioned above the progress bar which shold be the opposite.

In turn 1 the model Partialy fulfills the prompt instructions becuase the components are
not modular and scalable as required, one component is nested inside the other which
impacts the scalability and modularity of the code.

In turn 3, the model Punts because it refuses to do the requested changes while it can answer, but doesn't.

In turn 4, the model has an incomplete code issue because the changes does not produce the desired
behavior, now the first checked task fills aprox 50% of the progress bar and the next task fills 100%
of the progress bar.

Turn 4 also has a Major Visual Code Output Error issue because the progress bar does not produce an accurate
visualization.
