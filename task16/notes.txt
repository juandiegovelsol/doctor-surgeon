There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.

Turn 1 sucessfully creates the checking list as required where the list elements impacts the displayed percentage.

Turn 1 implements a circular progress bar as was required in the prompt

Turn 1 calculates the progress percentage according to the checked elements

Turn 3 achieves reflecting a change as the items are checked so every element checked or
unchecked creates a new visualization of the progress bar


Incomplete code: Turns 1, 2, and 4 have this error because the loading percentage is not reflected in the
progress bar, it is only reflected in the progress number.

Doesn't understand user intent: Turns 1, 2, and 4 have this error becuase the main goal of including a
progress bar is to display the percentage filling the corresponding part of the bar.

Formatting error: Turns 1, 2, and 4 have this error because the progress percentage does not match with the
progress bar filled part, creating inconsistencies between the information displayed and the
graphical representation.

Incorrect code: Turn 3 has this error because the model completly changes the progress bar, creating
something that is not a circular progress bar. Now, there are oval-shaped clips that rotates as
the progress changes

Wrong logical direction: Turn 3 has this error because the model takes a complete different approach
that significantly deviates from what a progress bar is.
