There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.



Turn 1 understands most of the instructions, it creates two columns for the desktop version splitting the achievemts into both, and merges the two columns into 1
for the mobile version.

Turn 1 seems to understand and tries to implement the offset for the achievement sections since the second column is moved in the vertical direction.

Turn 1 creates components for the header the achievemnts, and the footer as requested in the prompt.

Turn 1 uses all the requested dependencies and implements all the styles using SCSS.

Turn 1 has an incomplete code error since the model tries to implement the offset but it is not properly achieved. The achievement sections overlap and cover the footer

Turn 1 has an incomplete code error since the footer section is overlapped and can't be read.

Turn 1 has doesn't follow non-formatting constraints since the heigh offset is calculated as the 50% but this does not correspond to the exact 50% of the achievemnt heigh as required


Turn 2 doesn't understand the user intent since the prompt requires the model must only provide the modified files and returns components with no modifications

Turn 2 tries to modify the code but it has an incorrect code error since the main goal (which is fixing the overlap sections) is not being resolved in any way.

Turn 3 has an incorrect code error because it breaks the desktop version since now the achievements can't be seen, and all are overlapped

Turn 3 has a wrong logical direction error since the solution significantly deviates of the alignment requirements initially made.
