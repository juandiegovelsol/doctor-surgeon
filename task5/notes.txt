There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.

Turn 1 handles appropriately the cart state. The DishList component receives the cart state
 and the setCart method as props which are used optimally to display the currently
 selected quantity for each dish and to set the new cart array (preserving the previous state).

The ShoppingCart component receives the cart state appropriately to calculate the order total,
render the selected items, and control the "Your cart is empty" message.

The app component optimally handles the state logic and passes the different states and functions
as component props which is a robust implementation.

The textual explanation is accurate, explaining the overall application functionalities and
how all the components are integrated with the dished, cart, and orders states.


Turn 2 has an incorrect code error because it includes an escape character that breaks the ShoppingCart component, causing a compilation error and making the app impossible to execute.

Turn 2 has an instruction following issue since the model doesn't understand the user intent
to remove all the unnecessary escape and parenthesis characters present in the code.
It removes only a few unnecessary characters

Turn 2 has another instruction following issue since the model provides an unmodified
file and the promtp requires to provide only the files that need modifications.
The DishList.jsx file needed modifications that were not made.
