There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.


In turn 1 the model fully understands the prompt instructions. The star is positioned exactly in the middle of the gap between the obstacles, and it is removed from outside the container's boundaries.

In turn 1, the model makes all the necessary modifications to the code to allow the star to be positioned at the gap's center.

In turn 2, the model understands and implements the changing difficulty system that with each 10 additional points increases the obstacles' speed and decreases the likelihood bonus appears.

In turn 3, the model understands the required modification and tries to implement a system to come back to the previous object speed




In turn 2, the model has an incomplete code issue because the bonus interferres with the speed
increment assosiated to the increasing difficulty mechanism. The deactivateBonus function sets the
initialObstacleSpeed value to the obstacleSpeed variable, making the obstacle speed to be reset

In turn 2, the model Doesn't understand user intent because an incresing dificulty system designed to
increase the obstacles' speed every 10 points should't be reset by any other mechanism.

In turn 3, the model Doesn't understand user intent because the objects' speed behavior is the same
as in the previous turn. When the bonus is reset, the speed is reset to the intial speed.

In turn 3, the code has an incomplete code issue because the code has an unexpected behavior. Once the bonus has ended, the object speed returns to the previous value but suddendly it increments the speed considerably without any logical reason. 

In turn 3, the code has an incomplete code issue because the restart game feature is broken. Now the game can't be restarted pressing the spacebar.


I have a flying bird game that flaps its wings to keep it in the air while avoiding coming obstacles. The game increments the scores as the obstacles are surpassed and the game ends when an obstacle is hit.

The game has a bonus system that is activated when a red star is caught with the flying bird but the problem is that the red star is not correctly positioned. It should be positioned between the obstacles, exactly in the middle of the obstacle's gap, and move along with them. Currently, the star appears outside the game container boundaries so it can't be reached. Fix the problem and return the complete code.

Great! Now I want to improve the game and make it more difficult as the score grows. With each 10 additional points, the obstacles must move faster and fewer bonuses must appear. Implement the code and briefly explain the changes made.
