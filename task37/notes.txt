There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.

In turn 1, the model implements a customized bullet point as the prompt required for an unordered
list using HTML and CSS.

In turn 1, the model includes a bumping effect that increases and decreases the bullet point size.


In turn 1, the model has an incomplete code issue because the generated figure is not a heart. It 
is a rotated square.

In turn 1, the model has a major inaccurate claim because all the explanation about how the heart
shape is created is incorrect. The generated shape is not a heart

In turn 1, the model has a verbosity issue because the explanation is too long, the code is simple
and does not require such a long explanation, only to highlight the key points.
