latex error
Ambiguity - First example should say rechart and not axios because both use axios
Confusing structure - The response is not well organized, first provides code for rechart
and then includes the example section for rechart
Minor Visual Code Output Error, for the chart.js implementation the data can't be correctly
read because the chart height is too narrow


In turn 1, the pointed error that keys are missing is not correct, the app is not
creating dinamyc elements so the key prop is not necessary. Also, the sort method is
mandatory because the retrieved data from the API has first the newest records

In turn 1 there are some missing errors that were not pointed by the CB

The processing error pointed by the CB is not valid because the code processes historicalData
as an object of arrays where each array position is other object.
