There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.


Turn 1 successfully achieves the requested responsive behavior. The grids are vertically centered
for desktop devices and horizontally centered for mobile devices. Also they are evenly spaced
in the required direction accorging to the instructions.

Turn 2 does not hide the left grid so all the time is visible, understanding and following the main
request.

Doesn't follow non-formatting constraints: in turn 2, the model does not remain all the other
features intact because it modifies the way the colored cells are displayed.

Incomplete code: in turn 2, the model breaks the previous game functionality because the cells are
not properly colored for each game turn.

Doesn't understand user intent: for turn 3. The main goal of the game is to memorize the pattern displayed
on the left grid, it does not makes sense to keep it visible as in this turn.

Wrong (logical) direction: the code significnatly deviates from the intended task logic. The memorizing
process implies that the initial displayed pattern must be hidden and reproduced on the left grid.
