In turn 1 the model understands all the requirements to create the application, it displays companies as
graph nodes and its relationships as links between nodes.

In turn 1, the model follows all the constraints and uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and d3 to
implement the solution.

In turn 2, the model understands some of the prompt requirements and implements a form to add new
unique companies with a single relationship. The implementation shows an informative message

In turn 2, the model increments the node repulsion force between nodes to increment the space
between them.

In turn 3, the model understands which nodes have to be wiped so only the current graph representation
remains visible. The response is almost perfect




Turns 1 and 2 has a Minor Visual Code Output Error because the companies text overlaps and the
nodes/labels can't be seen correctly

Turns 1 and 2 has writing error because a character string seems to be in a foreign language or written with
irrecognizible characters

Turn 2 has an Incomplete code issue because the previous nodes are not removed when the graph
is updated and includes the new node, resulting in duplicated nodes that have no relationships
