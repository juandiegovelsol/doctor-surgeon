There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.


Turn 1 handles most of the requirements and understands almost all the prompt instructions.
3 different falling shapes are generated that can be caught with a click adding 1 point. If the shape
falls below the game container a point is subtracted. The game is won when 20 points are
reached and lost when the score is 0.

Turn 1 prevents any action to be taken when the game is over as the prompt requires which
reflects deep understanding of the user intent.

Turn 1 has an incorrect code error since the triangle shape is not a triangle, it is a square since
the shape and the triangle classes are applied at the same time. The shape
class gives the square shape and the triangle class can't be applied correctly

Turn 1 has multiple major inaccurate claims since in the explanation the model mentions that the
triangle is actually a triangle, when it is not.

Turn 1 has an instruction following issue since the model does not understand the user intent
for the explanations to be concise, it provides the user with extensive explanations.

Turn 2 still has an incorrect code error since the triangular shape is not correctly achieved. The
triangle class does not generate a triangle

Turn 3 correctly implements the triangular shape as required, the width and height properties are
removed from the shape class and set in only for the circle and square classes. This allows the
triangle to have only the border shape, creating a geometric triangle.
