There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.




Turn 1 successfully implements the game mechanics required, creating a super grid that is filled
whith the smaller game winner. The game ends when a played wins 3 games in a row creating a row of
its character

Turn 2 tries to achieve the given instructions and reflects user intent understanding as it claims in
the explanation text. It also tries to achieve the enablement feature but this can be correctly tested
because the game is not playable (it seems to work correctly)

Turn 3 achieves the described dimension issues and makes all the cells to fit inside the super-cell.

Turn 1 has a minor incomplete code error because the smaller grid is not contained inside the bigger
box, which gives an undesired looking to the super grid. Smaller grids are overflowed from the super
grid cells.

Turn 2 has a major incorrect code error because the grid is broken, now each smaller cell has the width
of a bigger cell making the game unpleyable.

Turn 2 has an incorrect claim because it says the modifications ensure the smaller grids fit perfectly
within the bigger grid cells, which is not happening.

Turn 3 has a minor incomplete code error since when a cell is pressed its heigth changes, making the cell
unproportioned
