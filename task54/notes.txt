I want to create an interactive and customizable jigsaw puzzle application where users can upload an image and generate a 5 by 5 puzzle that has to be reorganized.

The application flow must be as follows:
- The user uploads an image that must be adjusted to a fixed dimension.
- The puzzle must be generated, the 25 pieces must be created and each piece must have the corresponding part of the image that allows the user to solve it.
- The pieces must be shuffled around the window.
- The user must have to reorder the pieces to create the whole original image again.
- The puzzle is solved when all pieces are reordered and the original image is formed again.

Create the application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Generate a one-paragraph explanation.

Great! Now I want the user to be able to pick the difficulty level between 4 levels before generating the puzzle:
- Easy has a 5x5 grid as currently implemented.
- Medium has a 7x7 grid so more pieces are generated.
- Hard has a 10x10 grid.
- Expert has a 15x15 grid with a lot of pieces.





The model's ability to create the puzzle is impressive, it takes the uploaded image and creates
shuffled pieces. Then the user is able to drag and drop each piece to the desired position and
conform the whole image again.

The model correctly normalizes the positions in turn 3 and now the winning condition can be met.

The model understands and implements the different difficulty levels as required while remaining
all the other implemented features.





Turn 1 has a Mismatched Code Execution Result because it expects the game to display the winning
message while it is not generated.

Turn 1 has an incorrect condition error because the winning condition is not correctly formulated,
it does not evaluates when the pieces are ordered because the data-original-position attribute is
stored as '-0px -0px' while the backgroundPosition has the '0px 0px' value. Those strings will never
be the same and the condition will never be meet.


Turn 1 has an Incomplete code issue because the winning part of the game is flawed.

Turn 2 has a Misleading claim because the issue is not caused by whitespaces, it is caused by dashes
for 0px positions

Turn 2 doesn't understand the user intent because it does not provide new fixed code, it only provides
textual explanations.
