The model understans the primary intention of the user because it generates shapes that intuitively
have to be dragged to the corresponding dashed silhouettes.

The model follows most of the prompt instructions because it generates random shapes with random
colors and sizes. It first implements only squares and circles.

Turn 2 understands the issue and fixes it. Now all the shapes can be dragged and dropped inside
their corresponding silhouette.

Turn 2 follows the length constraints for the textual explanations, it is only one paragraph length.

Turn 2 provides an accurate explanation of the issue and how it was solved. It was accessing null
object properties and modified the code to correctly capture the desired shape to read its properties
and compare them in the conditional statement

Turn 3 fully understands the instructions and now the dashed lines are colored matching their
corresponding shape.




Turn 1 has an Incomplete Code issue because the shapes can't be dropped inside the shadowElement
and return to their original position, making the educational app to have considerable flaws.

Turn 1 has an Undefined Method/Variable issue because the dataset property that tries to access the
conditional statement does not exist, and causes an issue

Turn 1 has a Doesn't follow formatting constraints becuase the prompt asks to provide very brief 
explanations while the response is not very brief.

Turn 4 has an Incomplete Code issue because the generated shape is not a triangle, it is a square.

Turn 4 has a "Doesn't follow non-formatting constraints" issue because all the previous functionalities
are not applied to the new shape (for instance, the silhouette is not dashed and it is filled with a color)

Turn 4 has a "Major Visual Code Output Error" because the model tries to generate a triangle but
the shape corresponds to a square
