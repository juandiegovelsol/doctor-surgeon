There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.



Turn 1 successfully creates the restaurand API, that stores the dishes information in a
global variable, and exposes a get endpoint to retrieve all dishes with the corresponding
informnation.

Turn 2 successfully implements the required modifications, the package json is updated
to support ECMAScript modules instead of common JS and the enpoint returns a OK status

Turn 3 successfully integrates the new required endpoint. The API now allows to create orders
with the available dishes, calculates the order total and returns an adequate response message.
It is great that the new endpoint covers many edge cases such as when the request body format is
incorrect, the ID and quantity values are negative, the ordered dish has no sufficient available
quantity, and there requested item does not exist. This turn also provides test cases as requested




The turn 3 has an Instruction following error, because it adds information that was not asked for
and that is unneccessary. In the first turn, the prompt requires installation instructions, those
are still applicable for turn 2 since the package json was modified, but it is redundant and
unrequested information for the turn 3. The code only has modifications but the project is already
installed.
