Responsive Design, UI/UX Prototyping

In turn 1, the model understands some of the prompt instructions and tries to implement a React with
JavaScript, Vite, and SCSS application that has a section for uploading images and another section
for visualizing them.

In turn 2, the model fixes the described issue by adding the corresponding class to apply the media query styles, now the application is executable and functional.

In turn 3, the model fully understands the new requirements, now both sections fills exactly the complete or half window's width/heigth according the conditions. Also, the model modifies the Code to display the full image inside the visualization container.




Turn 1 has an Incorrect Code issue because the media query rules have incorrect syntax errors when
using SCSS, this cause an execution error and the entire application can't be executed.

Turn 1 has a Doesn't follow formatting constraints issue because for the desktop version the image
preview section is positioned on the left and the drag and drop section on the right while the prompt
requires them to be positioned in the opposite way.

Turn 2 has an Incomplete Code issue because the visualization container adapts to the image dimensions
causing that when the image is oversized, the drag and drop container is moved out of the window's
boundaries and that all the content is not fully visible

Turn 2 has a Formatting / Style Error because the applied styles doesn't allow appropiate visualization
of the app's content.

Turn 3 has a minor inaccuracy because the App.scss file was not updated as it claims

Turn 3 has a verbosity issue because it is not necessary to include App.scss, it makes the response 
more difficult to read and it is information already present in previous turns.
