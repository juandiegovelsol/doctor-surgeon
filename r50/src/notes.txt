Misliading claim because the taskProvider can't wrapp the App component in the App.js file,
this makes no sense because to wrapp a component it must be imported from a different file.

Confusing structure because the model wraps the AddTaskForm.js, TaskList.js and TaskItem.js
files in the same code snippet for explaining them, this can be confusing for the user. Also,
the model does not implement the TodoList component in the App.js file so it is not clear for
the user how to use the generated todo list.
