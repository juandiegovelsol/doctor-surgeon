Turn 2 has an undesired modification because shots are not visible as in the first turn,
the model should have keeped this feature.

Turn 3 has a doesn't understand the user intent issue because the target does not respawns in a
random position, it restarts always in the same position.

The ckick to restart issue is valid but is not explained in a detailed way. It is an incomplete
code issue because the restart logic is not implemented
