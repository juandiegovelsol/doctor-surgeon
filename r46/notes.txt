Question 3: Add notes for any issues you encountered with what the assistant/model generated
Instruction Following Errors:
VALID
'Coding - Semantic - Condition Error - Incorrect Condition',
- Turn 1: The media query used (@media (max-width: 768px)) did not meet the userâ€™s request for "below 768px," as it included 768px, contrary to the explicit instruction.

- Turn 2: The dropdown menu functionality was inconsistent after resizing from desktop (>768px) to mobile (<768px), indicating incomplete reset logic.

VALID
'Coding - Semantic - Incomplete Code',
- Turn 4: The dropdown menu stopped working after resizing from desktop (>768px) to mobile (<768px) due to missing re-initialization of mobile-specific styles or event handlers.
VALID
'Instruction Following Errors - Doesn'T Understand User Intent',
- Turn 5: Dropdown behavior was inconsistent after resizing from desktop to mobile. The model failed to implement the required reset of mobile-specific styles and logic during resizing.


'Coding - Error Handling', 
Error Handling (Coding-Semantic):
- Turn 2: Resizing from desktop to mobile and back left the dropdown menu in a broken state due to incomplete reset logic and event re-initialization.
- Turn 3: The isAnimating flag was introduced to handle rapid toggles but lacked robustness for edge cases like interrupted animations or resizing during animations.

VALID
- Turn 5: Resizing from desktop to mobile and back left the dropdown menu non-functional, reflecting incomplete logic for resetting and re-initializing mobile-specific styles or behaviors.

Accessibility Errors:
VALID
'Instruction Following Errors - Constraint Following - Doesn'T Follow Non-Formatting Constraints', 
- Turn 1: Focus trapping for the dropdown menu was not implemented, making it inaccessible for keyboard users who could tab out of the menu while it was open.
VALID
- Turn 5: Focus trapping was still missing, violating accessibility standards.

Feasibility Errors:
'Reasoning Errors - Feasibility Errors - Overly Complex',
- Turn 3: The forced reflow (offsetHeight) approach for dynamic height calculation introduced potential performance issues, as it could lead to layout thrashing and inconsistent behavior across browsers.

Incomplete Code:
VALID
- Turn 2: The desktop layout was not fully restored during resizing, leaving the navigation menu in a broken state after transitioning from mobile to desktop.
VALID
- Turn 4: The dropdown menu was incomplete after resizing from desktop to mobile due to missing resets for mobile-specific event handlers and styles.

Inefficient Code:
'Coding - Semantic - Inefficient Code'
- Turn 3: The CSS fallback max-height: var(--menu-height, 2000px); was redundant and potentially inconsistent with dynamically calculated height values from JavaScript.





ADDITIONAL
In TURN 1, the dropdown menu is positioned incorrectly on the bottom of the page while it should be positioned on top, for simulated mobile devices the menu is not visible
