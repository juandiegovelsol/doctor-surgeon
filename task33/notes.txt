There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.



In turn 1, the model understands and fixes the described issue, now the ships disappear at the bottom
of the game container as required.

In turn 2, the model understands most of the requirements and follows most of the instructions. Now the
ships can be shot by the bullets, the score is increased when enemies are shot or friendly ships
reach the bottom, and it is decreased when friendly shipe are shot or enemies reach the bottom

In turn 3, the model fully understands the requirements, increasing the bullets speed and decreasing
the ships speed.

In turn 3, the model realizes that the ship speed modification logic is not implemented and includes a
transition duration to modify the speed through the shipSpeed constant.




In turn 1, the model has an incomplete code issue because the friendly ships cause the score to
decrease when they reach the bottom, and the enemy ships to increase. It is the opposite way.

In turn 1, the model has an incorrect condition issue because the handleShipBottom should decrease
the score when the ship is enemy, not friendly.

In turn 1, the model has a incorrect code issue because the collision detection system was broken.

In turn 1, the model has a constant value issue because the shipSpeed cosntant is defined and never used.

In turn 2, the model does not understand that the ships must move slower because the current implementation
is ver difficult for the player to aim.

In turn 2, the model adds information that was not requested, because it decreases the bullet speed.
