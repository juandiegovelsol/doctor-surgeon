There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.



In turn 1, the model understand that the game starts displaying figures in an specific order and it reveals the 
shapes one by one as the prompt requires.

In turn 1, the model allows the user to enter the memorized pattern and then it is checked.

Finally, in turn 1, the code checks if the selected pattern matches with the initial pattern showed
and shows a message.

In turn 2, the model understands the prompt requirement and fixes the described issues. Now all the cards
have a different figure, the displayed pattern does not have repeated figures, and the pattern is hidden
once shown.

In turn 3, the model imlpements the requested features, now the game allows the player to continue
memorizing different patterns until an incorrect pattern is entered.





Turn 1 has an incomplete code issue because two of the generated figures does not appear, so the pattern can't be
correctly seen, memorized, and reproduced

Turn 1 has a "Doesn't understand the user intent" issue because the displayed pattern has the same 3
firgures. It is suposed to display random figures from all the possible options.

Turn 1 has a "Wrong (logical) direction" issue because the code shows the pattern to reproduce all
the time, this does not make any sense.
