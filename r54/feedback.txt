For 66e57573b7a5223856ca3c21 I would: (Based on 2 reviews)

- Suggest CB to do a more detailed code review to annotate all the issues in the task.
- Suggest CB to focus on coding prompts that involves reasoning, for instance he/she asked
the model to change plain text inside an application but this doesn't involve complex
reasoning, just text replacing or reasoning not related to coding.

For 66faae2631b8ee110efd769b I would suggest: (CB has only 1 task on web domain)

- Providing self contained code and ask the model to generate self contained code,
in the reviewed task, the initial prompt asked a very complex CSS file to be fixed but 
the HTML code was not provided, making the task impossible to demonstrate.


For 664568f4083deddbea097169 I would suggest: (Based on multiple reviews)

- Carefully annotate the tasks issues because some of them were not included.
