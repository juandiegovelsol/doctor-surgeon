There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.



Turn 1 implements the agility game mostly as required. It has the circle that colors at a "delay" random
time between the requested interval, it measures the elapsed time between the circle coloring and the event
click, and displays the top 10 lowest times.

Turn 2 modifies the code to display an initial instructions paragraph and to allow the game to start with
with the first circle click. Now, the circle's border is visible every time and only the background is
transparent or colored. This turn does not have issues according to the prompt. 

Turn 3 sucessfully identifies and removes the CSS line that was causing a potential delay in the reaction time

Turn 4 stores the 10 fastest reaction times in the localstorage to allow that information to be persistent.
When the page is loaded, the localstorage is consulted to get the recorded values, when a new time is recorded
the localstorage is set.




Incomplete code: Turn 1 has this error because the initial intruction paragraph can't be seen, since the game
is started inmediatly after the page is loaded.

Doesn't understand user intent: Turn 1 has this error because technically the initial instructions
paragraph is displayed but it is inmediatly replaced which is not the user's intent

Adds information that was not asked for: the model adds a transition when the circle is colored which was not
asked and can potentially delay the user's reaction time.

Minor Inaccuracy: Turn 1 has this error because states the CSS code must be stored as style.css in the same
directory while the CSS code is embeeded in the HTML file.
