for the described cases.

In turn 1, the model uses express and tries to use routes and controllers for building the application

In turn 2, the model understands that the issue is caused because the code was provided in a single
file, now it provides an invitations file and a server file. This fixes the issue and the application
works as required

In turn 3, the model creates separate files for controllers, routes, and the server, completly following
the prompt instructions and understanding the user requirements.


In turn 1, the model has a Incorrect Code issue because the code snippet can't be run as delivered
in a single file. The issue is caused because the code can't be executed in a single file as provided
since it imports the invitation routes as an external dependencie and it must be in other file.

In turn 1, the model has a Readability issue because all the code is provided in a single file,
making it hard to read and understand. It is a symple application but it would be better to provide
separate files for each part of the application.

In turn 1, the model has a formatting issue because it gives the invitation route an empty url "/"
and then sets the "/invitations" route for each controller, it should give the route the "/invitations"
route and each controller an empty route.
