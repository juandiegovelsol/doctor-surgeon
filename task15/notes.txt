There are no issues till Turn 3. However, there is an accuracy issue in Turn 4.
The number 3 has been removed, so it should be calculated as 0 on the sum. The blank face
could be shown on the front when rolling the dice. So the model should calculate the
total number of possible outcomes for each roll as 6x6x6=216, not 6x6x5=180.


Turn 2 removes the linear gradient that was the redundant part of the code, now the code is more
readable and efficient since there is no unnecessary computed CSS rules. This turn does not have
issues.


Turn 1 doesn't understand the user intent, the model does not remove the redundant code nor
maintains the requested functionalities, it modifies the entire component and implements
undesired changes.

Turn 1 doesn't follow non-formatting contsaints, the prompt was explicit by asking the current
implementation must remain intact (the spinning ring and the conic gradient inside the border)

Turn 1 takes a wrong logical direction for the same reasons explained above.

Turns 3 and 4 have an incorrect code error because the conic gradient is broken, now the ring has an
irregular and undesired shape that only shows blue, any transition between transparent and blue
can be seen.

Turns 3 and 4 doesn't understand the user intent. The model does not generates a conic gradient where
the blue edge extends to the corresponding progress angle and the remaining angle until 360
degrees is transparent.
