Turn 2 solves the rendering issues and implements an infinite loop prevention braking the loop after a desired number of operations



The code is very inefficient because it takes too long to load on the browser, it does not have multiple nested loops but still is requires
considerable resources.

The code has a major code output error because only a square can be seen but any maze or player is visible inside it.

The code has an infinite loop in the generateMaze function, it is caused because the while loop can be only breaked if the stack length is
negative or 0 which is impossible to make since it is always pushed and never sliced.

The model does not implements a scaping path so the game is not playable (major code ouput error and doesn't understand the user intent)

In turn 3 the model returns to the previous state and produces the same output as in the first turn. This code is useless
